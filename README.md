# UEFA-Competitions-Using-Sql

### **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes data from UEFA, one of the most prestigious governing bodies in football. By leveraging SQL, we explore and uncover insights about teams, players, matches, goals, and stadiums.

### **Dataset Description**  
The project uses five datasets in CSV format:  
1. **Goals**: Details about goals scored, including goal ID, player ID, match ID, and descriptions.  
2. **Matches**: Information on matches, including teams, scores, dates, and attendance.  
3. **Players**: Data about players, including their names, teams, positions, and attributes like height and weight.  
4. **Stadiums**: Information about stadiums, including names, cities, capacities, and countries.  
5. **Teams**: Details about teams, including their names, countries, and home stadiums.  

### **Project Objectives**  
The project focuses on answering key football-related questions, such as:  
- How many teams are in the dataset?  
- Which country has the most teams?  
- Who are the top scorers, and which team has the most goals?  
- What is the attendance trend for matches?  
- Insights into stadium capacities and their distributions.  

### **Key Features**  
- **SQL Queries**: Comprehensive SQL queries are written to solve 18 different questions, covering team statistics, player performance, attendance trends, and match analysis.  
- **Data Exploration**: Insights derived from the dataset include:  
  - Total number of teams and goals scored.  
  - Top-performing players in specific stadiums.  
  - Attendance statistics and match analysis.  
  - Identification of top scorers for each team.
